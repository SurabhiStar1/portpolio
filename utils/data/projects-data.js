The platform enables users to filter spots based on location, distance, time, and availability, while also allowing them to manage vehicles, view detailed booking information, make secure payments, and receive real-time notifications. I contributed to building a robust vendor and guard management system for efficient parking space tracking and dynamic status updates. Additionally, I developed an admin panel with role-based access control for super admin, state admin, city admin, and GTEs, along with a user-friendly interface to support efficient task management and system administration.',

The application features real-time room filtering, interactive room detail views, and a seamless booking process. I integrated Razorpay for secure and instant online payments, ensuring a reliable transaction flow. Additionally, I built a dedicated admin dashboard to manage bookings, rooms, users, and overall system dataâ€”empowering full control over the application from the backend. This project helped me deepen my understanding of full-stack development and payment gateway integration.',
